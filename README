Mifflin St. Jeor Formulas:

Men - 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) – 5 x age (y) + 5
Women - 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) – 5 x age (y) – 161

STANDARD ACTIVITY LEVEL MULTIPLIERS

BMR X 1.2: If you are sedentary = little to no exercise in a day
BMR X 1.375: If you are slightly active = light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week
BMR X 1.55: If you are moderately active = moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week
BMR X 1.725: If you are very active = hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week
BMR X 1.9: If you are extra active = very hard exercise/sports and physical job OR 2x training
